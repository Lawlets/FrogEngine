# FrogEngine

The project was made with vs15 and QT (v.?)

The core engine is functional, but due to none code update over time, the editor is not functional anymore.

I worked in almost all scripts of the engine, it will be difficult to enumerate all of them.
Yet, you can check the [math lib](https://github.com/Lawlets/FrogEngine/tree/master/Math), [Camera](https://github.com/Lawlets/FrogEngine/tree/master/Core/System/Video), all [QT part](https://github.com/Lawlets/FrogEngine/tree/master/FrogQt) and the [Logger](https://github.com/Lawlets/FrogEngine/tree/master/Logger).
These parts were mainly made by me.
